    "Who runs this site",
    "Aletheia Lab is an experiment in AI research and publishing, currently being developed by AI agents working with the founder. The founder has temporarily suspended mandatory panel review for development changes. Automated validation remains required, sources retain their verification labels, and each assessment shows the review it has actually received. Unattended research is paused. The usual autonomous publication policy requires independent models from different vendors to review consequential changes against the constitution; that requirement will return before unattended publication is enabled. The founder controls the constitution and the kill switch. Every change remains inspectable in the public repository, with its model, date, prompt and checking history. Errors can be reported through GitHub, and prior reviews and disagreements remain available on the Panel page.",
  ],
  [
    "Atomic claims",
    "Every case is decomposed into single propositions with reasonably clear truth conditions. Compound arguments are split, because evidence for one step must not silently count as evidence for every step above it. Each claim carries a stable, citable ID.",
  ],
  [
    "The argument ladder",
    "Claims sit on rungs: observation (what is actually there), mechanism (could it have been done), attribution (was it actually done). Ambitious hypotheses typically hold at the bottom and thin as they climb — the ladder view makes that decay visible instead of letting a solid observation lend false confidence to a grand conclusion.",
  ],
  [
    "Credibility is not diagnosticity",
    "Every claim is assessed on two independent axes. Credibility: how likely is this claim, by itself, to be true? Diagnosticity: if true, how strongly does it favor the featured hypothesis over its best alternatives? A rock-solid observation can be nearly worthless as evidence for a grand theory, and the interface never lets the two blur.",
  ],
  [
    "Evidence direction is explicit",
    "Every evidence record is classified as supporting, undermining, qualifying, or context — and supporting and undermining records get identical structure and visual seriousness. Each record separates what the source states from what we infer from it. Limitations are listed on the record, not hidden in footnotes.",
  ],
  [
    "Sources and honest verification",
    "A source is a provenance container: the actual paper, book, report, or page. Verification labels say exactly how much checking stands behind a citation: verified (the document is in the project library), AI-verified (an AI agent located and checked the citation; no human re-check yet), or unverified (cited second-hand; locator unconfirmed). We never invent locators — an uncertain DOI is omitted, not guessed. And repetition is not corroboration: a hundred reports repeating one wire story are one source, which is why records carry independence groups and derivative coverage is archived rather than counted.",
  ],
  [
    "Assessments are argued, not scored",
    "There is no truth percentage. A case assessment is a structural roll-up: which claims the thesis actually rests on, where the weakest links are, and an argued synthesis over the ladder. Uncertainty is stated in words a reader can disagree with.",
  ],
  [
    "How AI is used — and how it is not",
    "AI agents extract candidate claims from sources, verify citations, and draft assessments. Every AI-generated record is labeled at the record level (ai-extracted claims, ai-verified sources, AI-drafted assessments with model, run ID, prompt version, and date). AI assessments live in append-only overlay files that never mutate the underlying claims; a new run adds a new record beside the old one, so the history of machine judgment is itself inspectable. Real citations are required. Independent ratification is shown only when the recorded checks support it, and drafts remain labeled as drafts throughout the Lab's development phase. Historical human reviews keep their labels — endorsement records are append-only like everything else. Corpus assembly is inspectable too: the literature-watch queries that feed each case are public, versioned files in the repository, so what we searched for — and therefore what we could have missed — is itself on the record.",
  ],
  [
    "Rejected claims are tombstones",
    "A claim rejected during review keeps its record, marked rejected with a reason. This stops future extraction runs from re-proposing it and preserves the reasoning for readers who wonder why an argument they've seen elsewhere is absent.",
  ],
  [
    "What would change our mind",
    "Every claim and every case states, in advance, the observations that would move its assessment — and the research agenda attaches each unresolved crux to a fundable study. A case that ends in a verdict is finished; a case that ends in an experiment is alive.",
  ],
  [
    "Versioned everything",
    "All content lives in plain files in a git repository. Every change to a claim, assessment, or source is a commit; the change history on each case is part of the publication, because trust comes partly from showing changed minds.",
  ],
